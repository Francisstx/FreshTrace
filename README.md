# FreshTrace ðŸŒ±

A blockchain-based supply chain tracking system for agricultural products, enabling transparent farm-to-table traceability on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

FreshTrace provides a decentralized solution for tracking agricultural products from farm to consumer, ensuring transparency, authenticity, and food safety throughout the supply chain. Built with Clarity smart contracts on Stacks, it leverages Bitcoin's security for immutable record-keeping.

## Features

- **Producer Registration**: Farmers and producers can register and get verified
- **Batch Creation**: Track individual product batches with harvest dates, quantities, and locations
- **Event Tracking**: Log transportation, processing, and distribution events
- **Status Updates**: Real-time status tracking from harvest to retail
- **Verification System**: Contract owner can verify legitimate producers
- **Immutable Records**: All tracking data stored permanently on blockchain
