## QR Code Implementation Guide

### For Producers

1. **Generate Unique QR Codes**: Create unique identifiers for each batch
2. **Format**: Use alphanumeric strings up to 100 characters
3. **Best Practices**:
   - Include batch identifier prefix (e.g., "QR-BATCH-")
   - Add year/date information
   - Keep codes scannable and high-contrast
   - Test QR codes before mass printing

### For Consumers

1. **Scan QR Code**: Use any QR code scanner or FreshTrace mobile app
2. **View Information**: Instantly access complete product history
3. **Verify Authenticity**: Check producer verification status
4. **Review Quality**: View certifications and sensor data
5. **Track Journey**: See all supply chain events

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
clarinet test
```

Test coverage includes:
- Producer registration and verification
- Batch creation and management with QR codes
- Quality certification system
- Certification verification and assignment
- Event tracking functionality
- IoT sensor data recording
- Consumer verification via QR code
- Consumer verification via batch ID

- Complete verification data retrieval
- Access control and error handling
- Batch expiry validation

## API Integration Examples

### Mobile App Integration

```javascript
// Scan QR code and verify product
async function verifyProduct(qrCode, location) {
  const result = await callContract(
    'verify-product-by-qr',
    [qrCode, location]
  );
  return result;
}

// Get complete product information
async function getProductInfo(qrCode) {
  const data = await callReadOnly(
    'get-complete-verification-data-by-qr',
    [qrCode]
  );
  return data;
}
```

### Web Portal Integration

```javascript
// Display product information
async function displayProductDetails(batchId) {
  const verification = await getCompleteVerificationData(batchId);
  
  return {
    producer: verification.producer,
    batch: verification.batch,
    events: verification.event-count,
    sensors: verification.sensor-count,
    certifications: verification.cert-count,
    verifications: verification.verification-count
  };
}
```

## Security Considerations

- **Producer Verification**: Only verified producers can create batches
- **Owner Controls**: Critical functions restricted to contract owner
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation on all parameters
- **QR Code Uniqueness**: System prevents duplicate QR codes
- **Immutable Records**: All data permanently stored on blockchain
- **Certification Validation**: Automatic expiry checking for certifications
- **Access Control**: Proper authorization checks throughout
