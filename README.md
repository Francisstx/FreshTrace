- **Batch Creation**: Track individual product batches with harvest dates, quantities, and locations
- **Event Tracking**: Log transportation, processing, and distribution events
- **IoT Sensor Integration**: Automated tracking of temperature, humidity, and GPS coordinates
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Real-time environmental data recording for quality assurance
- **Quality Certification System**: Track organic, fair-trade, non-GMO, and other certifications
- **Certification Verification**: Contract owner verification of quality certifications
- **Certification Assignment**: Link multiple certifications to product batches
- **Certification Expiry Tracking**: Automated validation of certification validity periods
- **Status Updates**: Real-time status tracking from harvest to retail
- **Verification System**: Contract owner can verify legitimate producers and certifications
- **Immutable Records**: All tracking data stored permanently on blockchain

## Data Structures

### Producer
- ID, name, location, certification type
- Owner address and verification status

### Batch
- Producer ID, product name, quantity
- Harvest/expiry dates, current location and status
- Creation timestamp

### Event
- Event type, location, timestamp
- Additional notes for context

### Sensor Data
- Temperature, humidity, GPS coordinates
- Timestamp and batch association

### Quality Certification
- Certification type (organic, fair-trade, non-GMO, etc.)
- Certifying body and certificate ID
- Issue and expiry dates
- Verification status and issuer information

## Quality Certification System

FreshTrace now supports comprehensive quality certification tracking for various industry standards:

### Supported Certification Types
- **Organic**: USDA Organic, EU Organic, JAS Organic
- **Fair Trade**: Fair Trade USA, Fairtrade International
- **Non-GMO**: Non-GMO Project Verified
- **Sustainability**: Rainforest Alliance, UTZ Certified
- **Religious**: Halal, Kosher
- **Regional**: Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), Geographic Indication

### Certification Features
- **Multi-certification Support**: Each batch can have up to 10 different certifications
- **Expiry Tracking**: Automatic validation of certification validity periods
- **Verification System**: Contract owner verification required for legitimacy
- **Immutable Records**: All certification data permanently stored on blockchain
- **Traceability**: Full audit trail from certification issuance to batch assignment

### Certification Workflow
1. **Add Certification**: Certifying bodies or producers add new certifications
2. **Owner Verification**: Contract owner verifies certification authenticity
3. **Batch Assignment**: Verified certifications are assigned to product batches
4. **Validity Checking**: System automatically validates certification status
5. **Consumer Access**: End consumers can verify all certifications for any batch

## IoT Sensor Integration

FreshTrace supports integration with various IoT sensors for automated environmental monitoring:

### Supported Measurements
- **Temperature**: Recorded in centigrade Ã— 100 (e.g., 2200 = 22.00Â°C)
- **Humidity**: Recorded as percentage Ã— 100 (e.g., 6500 = 65.00%)
- **GPS Coordinates**: Latitude and longitude Ã— 1000000 for precision

### Data Recording
Sensor data is automatically timestamped and permanently stored on the blockchain, providing an immutable record of environmental conditions throughout the supply chain journey.
